What should the store be able to do?
x Store information
x Run an outside function whenever state changes
x Outside should be able to change store using "actions"
    x Actions are objects that describe something that happened
    x Actions are of a "type" and contain additional data (payload, info)
    x Actions reach the store via "dispatching" them
    x Store updates itself based on information from actions
